<br><span style="font-size: 1rem;">DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vlsi.2018.10.006&nbsp;<br><strong>Abstract: </strong>Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration (DPR) enables resource sharing in FPGA-based systems. It can also be used for the mitigation of aging-related permanent faults by increasing the number of redundant Partially Reconfigurable Regions (PRRs). Normally, these PRRs are able to host any of the Partially Reconfigurable Modules (PRMs), or tasks, at one particular instance. This kind of system is called homogeneous. However, the FPGA resource constraints limit the amount of homogeneous redundancy that can be used and hence affect the lifetime of the system. This issue can be addressed by utilizing the heterogeneous approach where each PRR now only hosts a subset of the tasks. Further, the deadlines of the applications must also be taken care of in the design phase to decide the mapping and scheduling of tasks to PRRs. To this end, we propose an application-specific multi-objective system-level design methodology to determine the appropriate number of PRRs and the mapping and scheduling of tasks to the PRRs. Specifically, we propose a lifetime-aware scheduling method that maximizes the system's mean time to failure (MTTF) with different tolerances in the makespan specification of an application. We use the scheduler along with an automated floorplanner for design space exploration at design-time to generate a feasible heterogeneous PRR-based system. Our experiments show that the heterogeneous systems can offer more than 2x lifetime improvement over homogeneous ones. It also offers better scaling with increased tolerance in makespan specification.</span></li>

However, the increasing physical fault-rates in electronic systems have led to single-layer reliability approaches becoming infeasible for resource-constrained systems. Dynamic Cross-layer reliability (CLR) provides scope for efficient adaptation to such QoS variations and increasing unreliability. We propose a design methodology for enabling QoS-aware CLR-integrated runtime adaptation in heterogeneous MPSoC-based embedded systems. Specifically, we propose a combination of reconfiguration cost-aware optimization at design-time and an agent-based optimization at run-time. We report a reduction of up to 51% and 37% in average reconfiguration cost and average energy consumption respectively over state-of-the-art approaches.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong>[ASP-DAC 2018] Lifetime-aware design methodology for dynamic partially reconfigurable systems</strong><br><em><strong>Siva Satyendra Sahoo</strong>, Tuan D.

The heterogeneous partitioning in such systems allows the user to exploit the application-specific mapping of Partially Reconfigurable Modules (PRMs) to PRRs to implement more efficient designs. It offers increased opportunities in optimizing the reliability of the system across multiple layers - from the low-level physical one to the higher application layer. This method, called cross-layer reliability, can potentially exploit the application-specific tolerances to the quality of service (QoS) to tackle the increasing device fault-rates more cost-effectively by distributing the fault-mitigation to different layers. In this work, we propose a QoS-aware cross-layer reliability-integrated design methodology for FPGA-based DPR systems. Specifically, our methodology analyzes the requirements of the

Instead of fixing everything at the hardware layer, cross-layer fault tolerance techniques present a more cost-efficient methodology for adapting to such increased fault rates. The effectiveness (Coverage, Fault-Masking, and Recovery) and overheads (Execution time, Energy and Cost) of each fault-tolerance technique vary with the layer and the frequency at which it is implemented. Therefore, appropriate modeling of fault-mitigation methods is necessary for efficient cross-layer design space exploration (DSE).

This poses major challenges for the design and testing of modem Multiprocessor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs). Intermittent faults constitute a major part of hardware faults and their fault rates can be used as an indicator of the wear-out in a Processing Element (PE). We propose a run-time task re-mapping method that uses this information to improve the useful lifetime of MPSoCs. We also propose a scenario-aware system-level fault injection technique for intermittent faults to evaluate system-level design techniques in MPSoCs. Our performance results conclusively show that our strategy significantly scales on reliability metrics with respect to number of PEs. Specifically, we show that our method can achieve an increase in lifetime of up to 16% and tolerate up to 30% more faults than state-of-the-art techniques.</li><li><strong>[DFTS 2016] Cross-layer fault-tolerant design of real-time systems</strong><br><em><strong>S.

</em><br>URL: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7684071&amp;isnumber=7684053 <br><br><strong>Abstract:</strong> Continued transistor scaling and increasing power density has resulted in considerable increase in fault rates of nano-technology systems. Cross-layer fault tolerance techniques present a more cost-efficient methodology for adapting to such increased fault rates as opposed to fixing everything at the hardware layer. The effectiveness (Coverage, Fault-Masking and Recovery) and overheads (Execution time, Energy and Cost) of each fault tolerance technique varies with the layer and frequency at which it is applied. The choice of appropriate fault-aware design should also account for the application specific design goals and constraints of real-time systems. To this end, we provide a brief survey of fault-tolerance methods and discuss their suitability to cross-layer design. We also provide a few case studies that motivate the need for effective design space exploration (DSE) for cross-layer fault-aware design of real-time systems and discuss a few factors that have a major impact on such DSE.</li>
